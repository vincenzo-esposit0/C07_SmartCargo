## FAQs
***
A list of frequently asked questions

**Q: What is the main objective of the project SmartCargo in the Port of Valencia?** <br>
A: The main objective of the project is to implement an integrated system aimed at enhancing port infrastructures, improving the safety and efficiency of cargo handling operations, and optimizing transit routes to reduce CO2 emissions.

**Q: What are the specific phases that the system must support?** <br>
A: The system must support various phases, including defining efficient routes for trucks, real-time tracking of trucks within the port, evaluating the routes taken, searching for information on trucks transited during a specific period, generating activity reports, and issuing alerts for security operators.

**Q: How will the system strengthen control over port activities?** <br>
A: The system will contribute to the control of port activities through the definition of correct routes, real-time tracking of vehicles, evaluation of routes taken, and the ability to generate detailed reports on activities.

**Q: How does the system prevent the illegal transport of goods?** <br>
A: The system prevents the illegal transport of goods by monitoring and accurately tracking vehicles, facilitating the detection of any deviations from authorized routes.

**Q: What are the functionalities of the alerting system for security operators?** <br>
A: The alerting system notifies security operators in real-time about critical situations or deviations from authorized routes, contributing to ensuring the safety of port operations.
